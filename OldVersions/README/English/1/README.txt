# IGNORE file

This project is for the documentation of my infamous `IGNORE` file that I use frequently on GitHub. The most common variant is `IGNORE.md` which is a markdown variant.

## History

Currently, I only can access the latest version of the file, its history is short, but hard to find.

**2020 Final edition Variant**

```markdown
# Ignore this file

I needed to make this file in order to create a directory to map out the file system further.
```

## Purpose

GitHub (and possibly Git itself) doesn't have an easy option to create folders/directories via GUI. This `IGNORE` file is used, so that I can create a directory path, even for an empty folder. Until any other files are uploaded to the directory the `IGNORE` file is stored in, it normally stays, until there is a need to remove it. Once many files (and or few binary files) are uploaded, the `IGNORE` file itself has now served its purpose, and can be deleted. It is usually deleted after a release is published that contains the original `IGNORE` file(S) and the next release purges (removes) all useless `IGNORE` files.
